# a semantic based javascript code viewer using Electron.js


## why this project?
The project is based on the lambda-view https://github.com/Jianru-Lin/lambda-view.
That is a web-based code viewer. I think it is a good idea to use it in local.
so i wrapped it into a electron app.

It is heavily developing...
